a) At first, I thought we were supposed to SCP into nachos.cs.fiu.edu, so I was wondering why it didn't work. So I tried to install nachOS from a JCCL machine (ocelot), and was getting an "unrecognized command line option "-fwritable-strings"" error. I then realized that I was supposed to run the "ssh nachos.cs.fiu.edu" when in ocelot to get it to work. After that, It ran smoothly.

b) Tests worked as expected. The single-step test was a bit confusing at first, but then I realized I needed to hit enter to continue. It looks like it is used to debug.

c) Threads Class is used to manage threaded routines. There are four main operations for the thread class: fork (creates a concurrent process with the caller), finish (cleans up a fork), yield (relinquishes control to CPU), and sleep (relinquishes control to CPU, but blocks the thread).
