	Project 4 had us implement Virtual Memory in our Nachos OS. As mentioned in the tips that we were given,
the files that we had to edit for this project were addrspace.h and addrspace.cc, machine.h and machine.cc, 
translation.h and translation.cc, exception.h and exception.cc.
	machine.cc is where we included a FIFO algorithm to handle any page fault exceptions, and this function
gets called always from exception.cc (where all the sys call handlers are).

	We were not able to get the entire implementation working due to time constraint, so it does not fully 
work as intended. However we believe that our logic was going in the right direction. 
	A general gist of how we believed the process should go was:
	Open Program->Memory allocation->Go into virtual memory->if pagefault->machine.cc FIFO->handle
		memory error.
